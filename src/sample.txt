I’m going to recommend a simple framework for evaluating and changing your behavior based on a combination of cognitive-behavioral therapy and ancient Stoic practices. It consists of the following steps: 1. Evaluate the consequences of your habits or desires in order to select which ones to change. 2. Spot early warning signs so that you can nip problematic desires in the bud. 3. Gain cognitive distance by separating your impressions from external reality. 4. Do something else instead of engaging in the habit. In addition, consider how you might introduce other sources of healthy positive feelings by: 1. Planning new activities that are consistent with your core values. 2. Contemplating the qualities you admire in other people. 3. Practicing gratitude for the things you already have in life.

We talk because we think it’s helping, whereas in reality it’s making things hard for us. If our spouse is venting, we want to tell them what they should do. In fact, all they actually want us to do is hear them. In other situations, the world is trying to give us feedback or input, but we try to talk ourselves out of the problem—only to make it worse.

Marcus also talks about the importance of breaking things down into their components and reflecting on each part in isolation. The idea is that when we analyze something in terms of its elements and focus on each in turn, asking ourselves whether it alone is enough to overwhelm us, the whole experience will tend to seem more bearable. Similar “divide-and-conquer” techniques are employed in modern cognitive therapy to overcome problematic desires and emotions.

Finally, remember what Marcus said about feeling gratitude instead of desire. In a sense, to desire something is to imagine having what you don’t have, the presence of something that’s absent. Gratitude, on the other hand, comes from imagining the absence of things that are currently present: What would it be like if you didn’t have this? If we don’t occasionally picture loss, reminding ourselves what life might be like without the things and people we love, we would take them for granted. Keep a journal of people and things that you’re grateful for, perhaps also focusing on what you can learn from them.

1. Morning Meditation. Think of the rising sun, the stars, and your small space within the whole cosmos. Mentally rehearse the key events of the day, imagining how Socrates, Zeno, Marcus Aurelius, or your own role model would cope with habits or desires. Picture how you plan to cope with any challenges and what inner resources or virtues you can employ. 2. During the Day. Practice Stoic mindfulness by looking for early warning signs of the habits or desires you want to overcome. Try to catch them early and nip them in the bud. Pause and practice accepting any feelings of unease with Stoic indifference. Gain cognitive distance from your thoughts and refrain from acting on your feelings. Engage in healthy substitute behaviors instead, which contribute to a genuine sense of fulfillment. You could also keep a written log or tally of certain habits, as described in this chapter. 3. Evening Meditation. At the end of the day, review how well you fared in terms of acting in accordance with your values—that is, virtues. In relation to desires, consider what you did well, what you did badly, and what you could do differently tomorrow. If it helps, imagine answering these questions before a wise Stoic mentor or even a panel of Sages, and consider what advice they might give you. Use what you learn to help prepare for the next day’s morning meditation.

Although the idea goes back to the early Stoics, Marcus actually learned how to perform every action cautiously and with a “reserve clause” from reading Epictetus’s Discourses.3 In essence, it means undertaking any action while calmly accepting that the outcome isn’t entirely under your control.

We say “reserve clause,” incidentally, because our expectations are reserved for what is within our sphere of control. We’re pursuing an external result “with the reservation” that the outcome is not entirely up to us. “Do what you must, let happen what may,” as the saying goes.

Later, Christians would take to adding D.V. (Deo volente, “God willing”) to the end of their letters, and Muslims likewise say inshallah to this day. There’s a wonderfully clear description of this sentiment in the New Testament: Now listen, you who say, “Today or tomorrow we will go to this or that city, spend a year there, carry on business and make money.” Why, you do not even know what will happen tomorrow. What is your life? You are a mist that appears for a little while and then vanishes. Instead, you ought to say, “If it is the Lord’s will, we will live and do this or that.”4

Stoics can only be obstructed externally, not internally, as long as they attach the caveat “Fate permitting” to their desires. For instance, when people disagreed with Marcus, he first tried to persuade them to see things from his perspective. However, if they persisted in obstructing what he believed to be a just course of action, he remained calm and transformed the obstacle into an opportunity to exercise some other virtue, such as patience, restraint, or understanding. His equanimity remained intact as long as he never desired what was beyond his grasp, which constitutes one of the foundations of the Stoic remedy for worry and anxiety.

Seneca calls this praemeditatio malorum, or the “premeditation of adversity.” The clearest example of this prospective meditation strategy in The Meditations comes when Marcus describes part of his morning routine—preparing himself for the day ahead by anticipating various obstacles. Whereas other Stoics focus on the threat of disease, poverty, exile, and so on, Marcus is clearly more concerned with facing interpersonal problems, such as dishonesty, ingratitude, or betrayal. He imagines himself encountering a variety of difficult people in order to accustom himself to coping with them. Begin the morning by saying to yourself, I shall meet with the busy-body, the ungrateful, arrogant, deceitful, envious, unsocial.

The Stoics defined fear as the expectation that something bad is going to happen, which is virtually identical to the definition originally proposed by Aaron T. Beck, the founder of modern cognitive therapy. Fear is essentially a future-focused emotion, so it’s natural that we should counter it by addressing our thoughts concerning the future. Inoculating ourselves against stress and anxiety through the Stoic premeditation of adversity is one of the most useful techniques for building general emotional resilience, which is what psychologists call the long-term ability to endure stressful situations without becoming overwhelmed by them.

However, he tells himself that feeling the need to escape from life’s stresses in this way is a sign of weakness. It might be what the Stoics called a “preferred indifferent,” but escape is not something we should demand from life or feel we really need as a coping tool—that sort of dependence on being able to escape from stressful situations just creates its own problems. Marcus tells himself that he doesn’t literally need to get away from it all because true inner peace comes from the nature of our thoughts rather than pleasant natural surroundings. He tells himself that resilience comes from his ability to regain his composure wherever he finds himself. This is the “inner citadel” to which he can retreat, even on the frigid battlefields of the northern campaign.

He believes that to do this effectively he must reflect, in particular, on two concise but fundamental Stoic principles:11 1. Everything that we see is changing and will soon be gone, and we should bear in mind how many things have already changed over time, like the waters of streams flowing ceaselessly past—an idea that we can call the contemplation of impermanence. 2. External things cannot touch the soul, but our disturbances all arise from within. Marcus means that things don’t upset us, but our value judgments about them do. However, we can regain our composure by separating our values from external events using the strategy we’ve called cognitive distancing. In other words, peace of mind can be achieved even in the chaos of the battlefield—as Socrates reputedly showed—or in the clamor of the Senate, as long as we keep our mind in good order. Marcus concludes by condensing this into six Greek words, perhaps quoted from a previous author, which we might translate as The universe is change: life is opinion.

Another simple and powerful technique is to ask yourself how you would feel about the situation that worries you in ten or twenty years’ time, looking back on it from the future. It’s an example of a more general strategy known as “time projection.” In other words, you can help yourself develop a philosophical attitude toward adversity by asking, “If this will seem trivial to me twenty years from now, then why shouldn’t I view it as trivial today instead of worrying about it as if it’s a catastrophe?” You’ll often find that shifting your perspective in terms of time can change how you feel about a setback by making it seem less catastrophic.

However, we can activate a surprising number of other beneficial psychological processes when we patiently and repeatedly picture stressful events. Therapy clients who are asked to mentally review emotional situations in this way may exhibit one or more of the following changes: 1. Emotional habituation, as described above, where anxiety or other feelings naturally wear off over time and become blunted through exposure to the feared situation. 2. Emotional acceptance, where we gradually reduce our struggle against unpleasant feelings such as pain or anxiety, come to view them with greater indifference, and learn to live with them—something that, paradoxically, often greatly alleviates emotional distress. 3. Cognitive distancing, where we increasingly view thoughts and beliefs with detachment: we begin to notice that it’s not things themselves that upset us but our judgments about them. 4. Decatastrophizing, where we gradually reappraise our judgments about the severity of a situation, of how awful it seems, downgrading it by going from “What if this happens? How will I cope?” to “So what if this happens? It’s not the end of the world.” 5. Reality testing, where we reappraise our assumptions about a situation to make them progressively more realistic and objective; for example, reevaluating the probability of the worst-case scenario or that something bad will even happen at all. 6. Problem-solving, where repeatedly reviewing an event leads us to creatively figure out a solution to some problem facing us—perhaps like Marcus and his generals’ paradoxical idea of deliberately marching their legionaries into a Sarmatian ambush in order to spring a trap on the enemy. 7. Behavioral rehearsal, where our perception of our ability to cope improves as we practice, in our mind’s eye, employing skills and coping strategies in an increasingly refined manner—for example, mentally rehearsing assertive ways to deal with unfair criticism until we’re more confident about doing so in reality. This can take the form of modeling the behavior of others whose way of coping we admire and want to emulate—we imagine how they would act and then picture ourselves doing something similar.

Anger stems from the idea that an injustice has been committed, or someone has done something they shouldn’t have done. It’s often associated with the impression that you’ve somehow been threatened or harmed by the other person, making anger a close companion of fear: “He did something to me that he shouldn’t have done—that was wrong!” Not surprisingly, the Stoic antidote for anger resembles the general therapy applied to desire we described earlier. So it’s worth briefly reviewing the typical steps in this approach and considering how they would apply to this passion: 1. Self-monitoring. Spot early warning signs of anger, to nip it in the bud before it escalates. For example, you might notice that your voice begins to change, or that you frown or your muscles tense, when you’re beginning to grow angry, or you may think of someone’s actions as unjust or in violation of a personal rule. (“How dare she say that to me!”) 2. Cognitive distancing. Remind yourself that the events themselves don’t make you angry, but rather your judgments about them cause the passion. (“I notice that I am telling myself ‘How dare she say that,’ and it’s that way of looking at things that’s causing me to feel angry.”) 3. Postponement. Wait until your feelings of anger have naturally abated before you decide how to respond to the situation. Take a breath, walk away, and come back to it a few hours later. If you still feel like you need to do something, then calmly decide upon the best response; otherwise, just let it go and forget about it. 4. Modeling virtue. Ask yourself what a wise person such as Socrates or Zeno would do. What virtues might help you to respond wisely? In your case, it might be easier to think of a role model you’re more familiar with, like Marcus Aurelius or someone you’ve encountered in your own life. (“A wiser person would try to empathize, put themselves in her shoes, and then exercise patience when they’re responding…”) 5. Functional analysis. Picture the consequences of following anger versus following reason and exercising virtues such as moderation. (“If I let my anger guide me then I’ll probably just yell at her and get into another argument, and things will get a lot worse over time until we’re not speaking anymore. If I wait until I’ve calmed down and then try to listen patiently, though, it might be difficult at first but it will probably start to work better with practice, and once she’s calmed down maybe she’ll begin listening to my perspective.”)

Indeed, Marcus says that when others hate, blame, or slander you, you should imagine looking into their souls and understanding what kind of people they really are. The more you understand them, the more their hostility toward you will seem misguided and powerless to offend you. He seems to have viewed Cassius in this way, which probably helped Marcus respond calmly to the sudden crisis of the civil war, whereas the Senate offered a knee-jerk reaction.

By contrast, anger assumes an unwarranted certainty about the motives of other people. Cognitive therapists call this the fallacy of “mind-reading”—leaping to conclusions about other people’s motives although they are always somewhat veiled from us. You should always remain open to the possibility that the other person’s intentions are not in the wrong.13 Consider that other plausible interpretations of their actions exist. Keeping an open mind will help you dilute your feelings of anger.

Throughout The Meditations, Marcus frequently expresses this in another way, by reminding himself to leave the wrong with the wrongdoer: “Does another do me wrong? That’s his business, not mine.” He who does wrong does wrong against himself; he who acts unjustly acts unjustly to himself, because he harms only himself, he says. The wrongdoer damages his own character; you shouldn’t join him in his misery by making the value judgment that he has offended and harmed you too.

For Stoics, kindness first and foremost means educating others or wishing they would become wise, free from vice and passion. It’s a desire to turn enemies into friends, Fate permitting. Marcus’s example of acting with kindness actually entails educating the other person in two of the most important strategies he mentioned earlier: 1. Anger does more harm to us than to the person with whom we’re angry. 2. Humans are essentially social creatures; Nature didn’t intend us to fight but to help each other.

So remember not to demand the impossible, and apply this technique to all forms of wrongdoing. Marcus believes that you will be able to show kindness toward others if you set aside feigned shock and surprise and adopt a more philosophical attitude to vice.

People say “I can’t believe this!” when they’re upset, but usually they’re describing things that are very common in life, such as betrayal, deceit, or insults. The Stoics realized that in this sense surprise is not entirely authentic and needlessly exaggerates our emotional reaction. By contrast, someone with a more philosophical attitude might say, “That’s no surprise, these things are bound to happen—c’est la vie.”

smoothly, even if they try to oppose us. After listing the ten Gifts from Apollo, though, Marcus also reminds himself to have this precept at hand when he senses he might lose his temper: “To be angry is not manly but rather a mild and gentle disposition is more manly because it is more human.” This is striking because, as we’ve seen, Cassius reputedly insulted him by calling him a “philosophical old woman.” He meant to insinuate that Marcus was weak. However, Marcus believed that in reality someone who is capable of exercising gentleness and kindness in the face of provocation is stronger and more courageous than one who gives way to their anger, as Cassius was prone to do. Whereas people like Cassius often mistake this passionate anger for strength, the Stoics viewed it as very much a sign of weakness. This brings us back to our story: What was the outcome of the civil war between Cassius the hawk and Marcus the dove?

Looking back, it seems more obvious to me now than ever before that the lives of most men are tragedies of their own making. Men let themselves either get puffed up with pride or tormented by grievances. Everything they concern themselves with is fragile, trivial, and fleeting. We’re left with nowhere to stand firm. Amid the torrent of things rushing past, there’s nothing secure in which we can invest our hopes.

MAKE A MORNING COMMITMENT Make this commitment to yourself: For the next week, when you wake up, you will have absolutely no expectations for the day—of others and of yourself, as well as of events—and see what happens. Tell yourself that you will take things as and when they come, that you will let the day unfold by itself. Commit to being open-minded, nonjudgmental, and accepting of others. Commit also to viewing obstacles or conflicts as opportunities for personal growth and not as forebearers of chaos and dis-ease.

For most, it will require changing deeply embedded patterns and ways. It is difficult for people who feel secure only through control—or, more accurately, insecure without it—to change gears. The fear of the unknown and unexpected is truly unsettling, particularly if you feel that you are relegating your well-being to others or to pure fate. Ongoing resistance—itself a form of control—is therefore to be expected during the transition. It is encouraging to know that there is always an important built-in safeguard: namely you.

FEEL THE FEAR As I mentioned earlier, fears have a strong physical presence. Note where they are located—chest, stomach, back, face, or somewhere else—and try to feel their presence. Feel them fully. Don’t shy away. As you are focusing on them, take slow, deep breaths through your nose. Draw your breath down to below your navel and feel the physical sensations, then exhale slowly. Be kind to yourself; give yourself permission to feel the fear. You are not a weaker person because of it. Your fears cannot harm you. If you are able to do this, you will soon feel more grounded, and with that your fears will weaken substantially. Remember, fears hate being examined too closely; they know you will soon realize their bark is much worse than their bite.

The bases of most fears are more illusory than real. If you constantly remind yourself of this, your fears will not undermine you. Try this simple reassurance exercise (preferably in your own words): “I am afraid and I know the reason. I also know that my fear will pass like it always has in the past, and that I will survive. So, it is okay to feel anxious. That is normal. I will just grin and bear it and let it run its course. It has in the past and it will again. I have faith that I will be okay.”

If you are at home, move to the opposite side of the room. Sit down and look back at your “other” self. Observe that fragile little per-son—your inner child—and sense how he or she feels. Is he looking disconsolately down at the floor? Is she slouched on the sofa? Does he look as if he is carrying the weight of the world on his shoulders? Next, the other, more detached “you” should reach out to help this vulnerable person. Comfort and reassure him. Let her know that everything will be okay, that you understand her fears and anxieties, that her burdens will not last, that she will survive. You can do this because you are not caught up in your little person’s fears and anxiety. Your guardian self is more confident, objective, and aware; she knows she can take care of both “yous.”

They offer an account of how it’s easily possible for any market to spike and collapse, even in the absence of irrationality, malevolence, or malfeasance. The takeaways are several. For one, be wary of cases where public information seems to exceed private information, where you know more about what people are doing than why they’re doing it, where you’re more concerned with your judgments fitting the consensus than fitting the facts. When you’re mostly looking to others to set a course, they may well be looking right back at you to do the same. Second, remember that actions are not beliefs; cascades get caused in part when we misinterpret what others think based on what they do. We should be especially hesitant to overrule our own doubts—and if we do, we might want to find some way to broadcast those doubts even as we move forward, lest others fail to distinguish the reluctance in our minds from the implied enthusiasm in our actions. Last, we should remember from the prisoner’s dilemma that sometimes a game can have irredeemably lousy rules. There may be nothing we can do once we’re in it, but the theory of information cascades may help us to avoid such a game in the first place.

If you’re already interested in a habit, working on challenges of just manageable difficulty is a good way to keep things interesting. Of course, not all habits have a variable reward component, and you wouldn’t want them to. If Google only delivered a useful search result some of the time, I would switch to a competitor pretty quickly. If Uber only picked up half of my trips, I doubt I’d be using that service much longer. And if I flossed my teeth each night and only sometimes ended up with a clean mouth, I think I’d skip it. Variable rewards or not, no habit will stay interesting forever. At some point, everyone faces the same challenge on the journey of self-improvement: you have to fall in love with boredom. We all have goals that we would like to achieve and dreams that we would like to fulfill, but it doesn’t matter what you are trying to become better at, if you only do the work when it’s convenient or exciting, then you’ll never be consistent enough to achieve remarkable results. I can guarantee that if you manage to start a habit and keep sticking to it, there will be days when you feel like quitting. When you start a business, there will be days when you don’t feel like showing up. When you’re at the gym, there will be sets that you don’t feel like finishing. When it’s time to write, there will be days that you don’t feel like typing. But stepping up when it’s annoying or painful or draining to do so, that’s what makes the difference between a professional and an amateur.

Professionals know what is important to them and work toward it with purpose; amateurs get pulled off course by the urgencies of life.

However, the benefits of habits come at a cost. At first, each repetition develops fluency, speed, and skill. But then, as a habit becomes automatic, you become less sensitive to feedback. You fall into mindless repetition. It becomes easier to let mistakes slide. When you can do it “good enough” on autopilot, you stop thinking about how to do it better.

Reflection and review enables the long-term improvement of all habits because it makes you aware of your mistakes and helps you consider possible paths for improvement. Without reflection, we can make excuses, create rationalizations, and lie to ourselves. We have no process for determining whether we are performing better or worse compared to yesterday.

My yearly Integrity Report answers three questions: What are the core values that drive my life and work? How am I living and working with integrity right now? How can I set a higher standard in the future?

Success is not a goal to reach or a finish line to cross. It is a system to improve, an endless process to refine.

It is the idea of pleasure that we chase. We seek the image of pleasure that we generate in our minds. At the time of action, we do not know what it will be like to attain that image (or even if it will satisfy us). The feeling of satisfaction only comes afterward. This is what the Austrian neurologist Victor Frankl meant when he said that happiness cannot be pursued, it must ensue. Desire is pursued. Pleasure ensues from action.

if you recline in unshaken comfort, it is not tranquillity; it is merely a flat calm. The Stoic Attalus was wont to say: "I should prefer that Fortune keep me in her camp rather than in the lap of luxury.

Ask Whether You Can Meaningfully Impact the Situation. Even if you feel you can change or have some impact on the matter or person, consider whether any success is worth the cost and energy—and anguish.

The beginning of love is to let those we love be perfectly themselves, and not to twist them to fit our own image. Otherwise we love only the reflection of ourselves we find in them. —Thomas Merton, No Man Is an Island1

Accepting our loved ones as they are is paramount to achieving love and intimacy. Not accepting them—quirks, idiosyncrasies, annoying habits, and all—severely hampers the love flow. We are in effect telling them that they are not good enough, that they fall short. And who wants to feel that way—particularly in matters of the heart?

Przez większość czasu powinieneś posługiwać się głosem pozytywnym/żartobliwym. Jest to głos osoby spokojnej, o łagodnym usposobieniu. Twoja postawa jest swobodna i zachęcająca. Najważniejsze, aby podczas rozmowy być odprężonym i uśmiechać się. Uśmiech – nawet podczas rozmowy telefonicznej – wpływa na ton głosu i jest wychwytywany przez rozmówcę.

Gdy ludzie są pozytywnie nastawieni, szybciej myślą, są skłonniejsi do współpracy i rozwiązywania problemów (zamiast do walki i stawiania oporu). Dotyczy to zarówno uśmiechodawcy, jak i uśmiechobiorcy: uśmiech na twojej twarzy i w twoim głosie zwiększy twoją własną sprawność umysłową.

Takiego samego głosu mógłbym użyć w negocjacjach dotyczących umowy, której przedmiot nie podlega dyskusji. Kiedy na przykład widzę klauzulę dotyczącą zrzekania się praw autorskich, mogę powiedzieć: „Nie zrzekam się praw autorskich”. Tak po prostu, w zwykły i przyjazny sposób. Nie przedstawiam alternatywy, ponieważ to sprowokowałoby dalszą dyskusję, dlatego po prostu składam bezpośrednią deklarację.

Teraz rozmawiasz ze mną”. Transakcja zakończona. Możesz być bardzo bezpośredni i konkretny tak długo, jak długo stwarzasz atmosferę bezpieczeństwa tonem głosu, który mówi: ja jestem w porządku, ty jesteś w porządku, wymyślmy coś.

– Przepraszam, mają być dwa egzemplarze? – odzwierciedliła moja studentka w odpowiedzi, pamiętając nie tylko o głosie didżeja, lecz także o tym, by odzwierciedlenie zostało wypowiedziane tonem pełnym zaciekawienia. Intencja większości luster powinna być następująca: „Proszę, pomóż mi zrozumieć”. Za każdym razem, gdy kogoś odzwierciedlisz, osoba ta przeredaguje swoje słowa. Nigdy nie sformułuje tego tak jak za pierwszym razem. Zapytaj kogoś: „Co przez to rozumiesz?” – a najprawdopodobniej wywołasz irytację bądź reakcję defensywną. Tymczasem lustro pomoże ci uzyskać jasność, której potrzebujesz, przy jednoczesnym zasygnalizowaniu szacunku i zainteresowania wobec słów drugiej osoby.

u osób, którym pokazano zdjęcia twarzy wyrażających silne emocje, mózg wykazuje większą aktywność w ciele migdałowatym, czyli w części odpowiadającej za odczuwanie lęku. Gdy jednak poproszono uczestników eksperymentu, aby nazwali te emocje, aktywność przenosiła się do obszarów odpowiadających za myślenie racjonalne. Innymi słowy, etykietowanie emocji – stosowanie racjonalnych słów do określenia lęku – zmniejsza jego pierwotną intensywność. Etykietowanie to prosta, uniwersalna umiejętność pozwalająca wzmocnić dobry aspekt negocjacji bądź osłabić negatywny. Istnieją jednak ściśle określone zasady dotyczące jej formy i wykonania. Przez to mniej przypomina pogawędkę, a bardziej formalną sztukę – na przykład chińską kaligrafię.

Nieważne jednak, jak się kończą, etykiety niemal zawsze zaczynają się mniej więcej od takich słów: Wydaje się, że… Słychać, że… Wygląda na to, że… Zauważ, że powiedzieliśmy „Słychać, że…” a nie „Słyszę, że…”. To dlatego, że ta druga forma – osobowa – wyostrza ludzką czujność. Gdy mówisz o sobie, wskazujesz, że jesteś bardziej zainteresowany sobą niż drugą osobą, oraz sprawia to, że bierzesz osobistą odpowiedzialność za następujące słowa – a także obrazę, którą mogą wywołać. Kiedy jednak ujmujesz etykietę w postaci neutralnego stwierdzenia zrozumienia, zachęca to drugą stronę do reagowania. Zwykle udziela ona dłuższej odpowiedzi niż tylko „tak” lub „nie”. Kiedy natomiast nie zgadzają się z etykietą, nie ma problemu. Zawsze możesz wycofać się i powiedzieć: „Nie powiedziałem, że

Ostatnią zasadą związaną z etykietowaniem jest cisza. Kiedy już etykieta została wypowiedziana, zamilknij i słuchaj. Wszyscy mamy skłonność do rozszerzania naszej wypowiedzi, do kończenia: „Zdaje się, że podoba ci się ta bluzka”, konkretnym pytaniem, jak na przykład: „Gdzie ją dostałaś?”. Jednak moc etykiety polega na tym, że zachęca drugą osobę do odsłonięcia się.

Wypróbuj to następnym razem, gdy będziesz musiał przeprosić za jakiś głupi błąd. Przejdź natychmiast do niego. Najszybszym i najbardziej efektywnym sposobem nawiązania natychmiast działających relacji jest przyjęcie do wiadomości negatywnych emocji i rozproszenie ich. Zawsze gdy miałem do czynienia z członkiem rodziny zakładnika, zaczynałem od stwierdzenia, że wiem, że się boją. A gdy popełniam błąd – co często się zdarza – zawsze przyjmuję do wiadomości złość drugiej osoby. Odkryłem, że zaczynanie wypowiedzi od „Wiesz, jestem dupa wołowa”, stanowi zaskakująco skuteczny sposób rozwiązywania problemów.
